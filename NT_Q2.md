**2.2 NT Q2: Statement of Purpose (SOP)**

My fascination with Artificial Intelligence began with a curiosity to understand how machines could learn, adapt, and even make decisions. This interest solidified when I worked on the WiDS Machine Learning project *Neural Voyage*, which deepened my understanding of various types of machine learning—supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning—as well as key models and neural networks. That experience laid a strong foundation in the theoretical and practical aspects of AI.

I am driven by the desire to explore how intelligent systems function and how to build models that mimic human reasoning. The vision of creating systems that can assist or automate human tasks, making lives easier and more efficient, is incredibly exciting to me. I want to explore the boundaries of near-conscious models—not just to understand how they work, but to truly enjoy the creative process of building them.

As a member of the AI Community, I aim to take up responsibility and contribute meaningfully by developing tools and solutions that are genuinely useful to the IIT Bombay community. I am especially interested in pushing the limits of *InstiGPT*, enhancing it into a more comprehensive and functional GPT-based assistant tailored for campus needs.

In addition, I would actively collaborate on open-source projects, assist in organizing AI workshops, and mentor juniors once I’ve gained enough experience. I would also love to help in writing clean documentation and improving existing models through rigorous testing and optimization.

I hope to gain a deeper grasp of the mathematical foundations and coding intricacies behind AI. My goal is not only to apply existing models but also to understand them well enough to reason through their logic, strengths, and limitations. I believe that this will empower me to grow as a Junior Engineer and contribute to innovative projects that leave a lasting impact.
